## Install
### Windows
[Instalaltion video](https://u.pomf.is/rnugfa.mp4)
Installation on windows requires extra steps.


Navigate to www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml and download `lxml-3.6.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl`. Install it using `pip install lxml-3.6.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whll`. If you get an error (very unlikely) try the `lxml-3.6.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl` instead.

Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266)

After that you can install the actual script. Clone this repo and navigate to it, run `python setup.py install`.
### Unix (OSX/Linux)
Clone this repo and navigate to it, run `python setup.py install`.


## ToDo
- [X] Fix output to not overwrite
- [X] Fix json output to look like http://pastebin.com/dZy4ZNf5
- [x] If no password is given, randomize password for each account
- [x] Make the different functions not wait for eachoter (Threading)
    - ~~Too scared to do this part :/~~
- [ ] Gain publicity
    - Too scared to do this part :/ might gain issues we need to fix
